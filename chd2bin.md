# CHD2BIN

## Description
Convert files from CHD format (compressed optical images CD/DVD/BD / MAME compatible) into BIN/CUE uncompressed format.

Many software emulators (DuckStation, PCS2, Redream) and hardware (MiSTer FPGA) compatible with CHD,
however "real" hardware / ODE and Analogue Pocket PCEngine core do not support CDH.
This script allows to have entire library in CHD format and on-demand convert CHD to BIN/CUE.

Usefull to convert some files from compressed to uncompressed.

## Usage:
